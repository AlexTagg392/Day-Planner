## Description:
   I was given the following User Story to take and develop a program to fit the user's needs:

    AS AN employee with a busy schedule
    
    I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
    
    SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## Installation:
    No installation needed
    https://alextagg392.github.io/Homework_Day-Planner/

## Usage:
    This is a very useful program where any user can use it to schedule out their day.

## Contributing:
   These instructions were given from the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp from the University and Trilogy. They are as follows:
    
    GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

    WHEN I open the planner
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

    WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

    WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
    THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

    WHEN I click into a timeblock
    THEN I can enter an event

    WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage 

    WHEN I refresh the page
    THEN the saved events persist
